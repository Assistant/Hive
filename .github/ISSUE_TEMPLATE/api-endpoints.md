**Endpoint:**  

**Description:** 

**Why?:**

**Assumptions:**

Example: 
**Endpoint:** `GET /mods/:id/:gameVersion?`

**Description:** Get a list of versions objects that match a mod id, optionally filtered for gameVersion.

**Why?:** Getting a listing of versions of a mod filtered by gameVersion can be useful for manual dependency resolution.

**Assumptions:** I'm assuming dependency resolution will not take place on the server.
