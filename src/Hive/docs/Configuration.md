# Configuration Overview

Configuration is done from Hive's `appsettings.json` file, located in the root of its directory. When developing Hive, the `appsettings.Development.json` file will be used instead.

This is a quick landing page for Hive's configuration. Further documentation can be found through their dedicated pages.
